### `Employee`
__Employee Lab:__ Practice Making a Class

Create a class to model an Employee. Every class has three parts - FIELDS, CONSTRUCTORS, and METHODS.

##### Fields:
The Employee class should have the following fields(instance variables):
firstName (String) , lastName (String), age (int), idNum (String), title (String), and salary (double)

##### Constructors:
The Employee class should have **two constructors**:
1. Default constructor which gives default values to all fields(instance variables).
2. A second constructor which sets all fields via input from parameters EXCEPT ID_num which should be set to the String “00-000-0000”


##### Methods:
The Employee class should have the following methods:
- **getFirst** – returns first name
- **getLast** – returns last name
- **setID** – which takes a String parameter and uses it to change the ID_num field
- **getID** – returns ID number as String
- **increaseAge** – which adds one to age
- **giveRaise** – adds an amount given as a double parameter to the current salary
- **changePosition** – takes 2 parameters (a String representing a new title and a double representing a new salary) and changes the title and salary
- **fire** – sets the title to "terminated" and the salary to zero
- **printPersonnelReport** – prints all fields in an appropriate way


### `Car`
Together with a partner create a Java class to represent a car. You should have AT LEAST 3 fields of different data types, 3 or more constructors including a default, and 5 methods (at least 2 accessors and 2 mutators). Discuss it together and write it up together as a GOOGLE DOC. Submit to classroom to share it.


### `Dragon`
__Design Your Own Class__
1. Propose an idea for a class of your own. Create a google doc and go through the process of asking the design questions above and writing this in the doc.
2. Test your idea for a  class for cohesion and **write a short argument** as to why you think it will be cohesive.  My idea for a class cohesive because………… Evidence of this is………
<br>USE what you know about writing an argument.
3. Implement your class in BlueJ. Include at least 4 fields, a default constructor  and  at least 1 other constructor, and 5 methods - at least one of which is an accessor and one of which is a mutator.
