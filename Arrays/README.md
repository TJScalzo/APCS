### Arrays
So... There weren't really any instructions for this. I just read [Chapter 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2By5Y_DrT_RN3J0S25fdVZqbDg/view) of Barron's AP Computer Science textbook.

Then I decided to try and apply what I learned to the existing system of classes which is `Bank`, `Employee`, and `BankAccount`. It's very likely that you won't be able to replicate what I've done. But I don't care, I'm not trying to be a teacher or anything.
