### 2D Arrays Practice

1. Create a 5 by 7 2-D Arrays of ints and loop through it and fill with the number 3.  Note: you cannot use a For Each loop here - why?

2. Create an 3 by 4 2-D array of String objects using an initializer list.
  a. Loop through using a regular for loop and print them in **row major order** (as you read a book). 
  b. Loop through using a for each loop and print them in **row major order** (as you read a book). 

3. Using the same 2-D array of String objects from #2, loop through using a regular for loop and print them in **column major order** (top to bottom THEN left to right). Note: you cannot use a For Each loop here - why?

4. Create a 10 by 10 2-D array of anything using an initializer list.  Write 2 separate loops to **visit each element of the diagonals** and print them.
